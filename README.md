# TinyLM

TinyLM is an experimental project aimed at creating a small, efficient language model capable of basic conversational inference.  The goal is to train a coherent language model on modest hardware and with limited data, making it accessible for research, education, and resource-constrained applications. This repository contains the code and documentation for training and deploying TinyLM inference. Bring your own dataset.
